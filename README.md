This project is a esrXP re-implementation in python3, using wxWidget and OpenCV.

# Usage

Install `ffmpeg` with your package manager, or put the binary to $PATH. On Windows, this can be done by putting the prebuilt exe in the same folder.

Install dependencies by
```sh
pip install wxpython python-opencv tqdm
```

Then download and run `esr.py`.
